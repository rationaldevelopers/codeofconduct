# Rational Developer Code Of Conduct

* * *

This project may or may not use traditional computer terminology which may or may not offend several groups of individuals.

We believe that replacing such terms will **not** solve any real-world problems, so we don't do performative and unnecessary activities for any social agenda.

Instead, we focus on developing a great product that could be freely used by anyone regardless of their gender, ethnicity and beliefs.

We will not accept issues proposing politically driven replacements of the project's codebase terminology or changing the list of contributors because someone said something some individual or group takes offence at on any platform.

If this offends your feelings, feel free to walk away and never look back.

We welcome **anyone's** contributions aimed at making this project better and easier to use.

Because **functionality > _politics_**.

We treat each other with respect and value only each other's engineering skills.

What any of our contributors does outside of this project is their personal life choices.

We believe that very different people could and would easily get along when they spend their time actually working on this project.
